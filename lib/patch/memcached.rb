# Patch Memcached::Rails 
# https://github.com/evan/memcached/blob/master/lib/memcached/rails.rb
# To attempt to reconnect and ignore Memcached::ServerIsMarkedDead
#
# Note: we really don't care if the "reconnect" worked, we'll just continue
# to ignore the cache until it comes back.

    # memcached correctly, or lingering dead connections.
    # TODO: may want to investigate rather than use this blunt approach.
